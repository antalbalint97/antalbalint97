Using web scraping, SQL, and machine learning, it helps optimize meal planning and cost estimation.
- 🎮 SteamKit - is a future data analytics project focused on gathering and analyzing video game data from platforms like Steam. It involves web scraping, API data collection, and statistical modeling to uncover trends in game popularity, pricing, reviews, and player engagement. The goal is to create data visualizations and predictive models that help understand market dynamics and consumer behavior in gaming.
- 🛒 Receipt Tracker - For over a month, I have been collecting my own purchase receipts to develop a receipt-reading solution that analyzes personal spending habits. The project involves OCR (Optical Character Recognition) for extracting receipt data, SQL for database storage, and data visualization for spending insights. Additionally, it contributes to building a retail product price database, which could be expanded for consumer spending analytics and price trend tracking.
- 📈 Real Estate Analytics - is a future data analytics project where I plan to scrape data from ingatlan.com, to analyze property prices, market trends. By using web scraping, and statistical modeling, the goal is to create real estate price estimations, investment insights, and an interactive dashboard to help users make informed property decisions.
